            I would describe myself as being responsible, communicative, reliable and meticulous. 
            With a background in project management delivering all types of merch products to different types of customers I've discovered that there are more ways than one to work with problem solvning. Programming being one of them! <br>
            Soon I will be done with my first year at Nackademin and I have an exciting intership period ahead of me. <br>
            Apart from this I have also been trusted by my colleagues to be the workplace representative for the labor union and by my current classmates to be the student representative and also a member of the board of education for our program at Nackademin.
